# Next.js 15 App Router: Intermittent Data Display Issues with Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic routes and data fetching.  The application renders correctly on the initial load, but subsequent navigations to different routes can lead to unexpected blank screens or incorrect data being displayed.

## Bug Description

The issue occurs when navigating between dynamic routes.  After the initial render, subsequent navigations fail to update the displayed data correctly or may show a blank screen.  This seems to be intermittent and not consistently reproducible.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate between different routes. You should observe the inconsistent behavior after the initial page load.

## Expected Behavior

The application should consistently and correctly display data for all navigations between dynamic routes.

## Actual Behavior

The application may display a blank screen or incorrect data after the initial render when navigating between dynamic routes.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing data fetching and caching to ensure consistent data display.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a revised approach that addresses the inconsistencies.
